`Lush Green Gardens`

Welcome to Lush Green Gardens. This project came about after many frustrating interactions with non-technical 'technical recruiters'. Today for instance (5/29/18) a recruiter said I needed more green squares on my Github, seriously? Shade aside, the contribution graph on Github is ridiculously useless and to quote Sasha Romijn, "Any mechanism in our community that motivates people to avoid taking breaks and avoid stepping back, can be harmful to the well-being of contributors and is thereby harmful to open source as a whole."** In my opinion, it can be a cool thing as long as ONLY software developers are allowed to see and use it as a method of tracking PERSONAL progress, but in the hands of 'recruiters' or managers it becomes a problem.

Therefore this project is a quick exercise in proving the futility and uselessness of the contribution graph as a method of gauging a developers talent. To prove the point, I will spoof the graph by spelling my name on the graph. It's so ridiculously easy that I apologize in advance for even putting this on Github.

```How it works```

LushGreenGardens runs a script that writes words to file and then creates the necessary number of commits for each day in order to draw the letters on the graph. The fonts file indicates how the colors are created in the graph. In the green_gardens file you can change the number of commits to match your daily contribution level.
