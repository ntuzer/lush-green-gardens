`Lush Green Gardens`

Welcome to Lush Green Gardens. This project came about after many frustrating interactions with non-technical 'technical recruiters'. Today for instance (5/29/18) a recruiter said I needed more green squares on my Github. Shade aside, the contribution graph on Github is woefully useless and to quote Sasha Romijn, "Any mechanism in our community that motivates people to avoid taking breaks and avoid stepping back, can be harmful to the well-being of contributors and is thereby harmful to open source as a whole."


Therefore this project is a quick exercise to prove the futility and uselessness of the contribution graph. To prove the point, I will spoof the graph by spelling my initials on the graph. It's so ridiculously easy that I apologize in advance for even putting this on Github.

```How it works```

A script writes words to file and then creates the necessary number of commits for each day in order to draw the initials.
